So, in one of the classes I TA'd, we have talked about Turkish sentential negation. Apart from funky business going on with non-verbal or existential sentences, verbal negation can surface in two different forms: morphological *-ma/-me* or analytical *değil*. However, they are not interexchangable. The analytical form can only follow three aspects: prospective, imperfective, evidential. Note that it can only be used with nominals. 

One idea is that syntax handles this. And the reason for this distributional difference is that the morphological one is closer to the verb, while the analytical one is syntactically higher. The order can be simplified as this: Verb > Mod > Neg(ma) > Mod(Poss) > Asp > Neg(değil) > Tense.
