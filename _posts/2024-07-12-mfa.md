title: Guidelines to Run Montreal Forced Aligner for a PCIbex Experiment
---

I have recently co-designed and co-taught a series of workshop in the [Linguistics Department at the University of Oxford, UK](https://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/). The workshop was about sentence production and timing evidence we can have using PCIbex experiments and  the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA). One of the courses I thought was about how to use MFA for aligning audio files with their corresponding transcripts using R only. You can read the full tutorial [here](https://utkuturk.com/mfa.html).
