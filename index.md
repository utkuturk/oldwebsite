I am Utku Türk. I am an MA student in [the Department of Linguistics][dept], [Boğaziçi University][uni] under the supervision of [Pavel Logačev][pavel]. I mainly work in agreement attraction in Turkish. Currently, I focus on the effects of response bias in agreement attraction and whether or not everyone is affected uniformly by the bias-related manipulations. You can also check my [CV][cv] and [Google Scholar][gsoc]!
  
In my department, I also work as a Research/Teaching assistant. My responsibilities include TA'ing classes, working in projects within the department, and help the department in administrative issues.
  
I am interested in morphology and its interaction with semantics and phonology. I was lucky to join [Pavel Caha][caha] at [Masaryk University][mas] to work on various topics including Turkish case syncretism, augmentatives, and suspended affixation. Moreover, I also worked on the semantic interpration of the formative _-mışcasına_, a hypothetical comparative marker similar to _as if_ in Turkish. 
  
I am an [Universal Dependencies][ud] enthusiast. I participated in the creation Turkish and Laz treebanks. I am currently working on a Romeyka and Ladino treebanks.
  
In my freetime, I usually play games on [Steam][steam] or take amateur [photographs][flickr]. My favorite food is [gata][gata] with koritz and my favorite icecream flavor is [saffron and rose][rose].
