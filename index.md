I am an upcoming Ph.D. student in [linguistics][umdling] at University of Maryland. I will complete my MA thesis under the supervision of [Pavel Logacev][pavel] in [linguistics][dept] at BoÄŸaziÃ§i university this june. my MA thesis is about *agreement attraction* in Turkish. I investigated how (i) case syncretism, (ii) form heuristics, and (iii) response bias interacts with agreement attraction.

the places my mind wondered around:
- semantics of [hypothetical comparisons][hc],
- morphosyntax of augmentatives,<!-- [augmentatives][aug], -->
- syntax-phonology interface of Turkish cases, <!--[Turkish cases][case],-->
- influence of vowel harmony on suspended affixation, <!--[suspended affixation][sa],-->
- the phonemic status of ["glide" [ j ]][glide], 
- formation of Turkish and Laz treebanks, <!--[Turkish and Laz treebanks][trlazud],-->
- language contact between Greek and Turkish, <!-- [Greek and Turkish][grtr] in Asia Minor.-->
