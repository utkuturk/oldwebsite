## sentence planning

My primary focus at the moment is on the flexibility that speakers show when planning sentences. I am currently working on to <span class="foc">understand how morphological planning</span> is carried out and whether <span class="foc">agents have special status</span> in planning. My goal is to eventually tie this to the work focusing on exploring  <span class="foc">generative grammars</span> and how <span class="foc">they can explain the planning procedure</span>. Broadly, I’m interested in online sentence building and its interaction with syntactic structure.

## sentence processing

I am interested in people's degree of fallibility when it comes to comprehending number agreement. I am currently working on to <span class="foc">reconcile conflicting findings</span> on whether attraction effects are modulated by <span class="foc">case ambiguity</span> in sentence comprehension. My goal is to eventually tie this to the work focusing on exploring how people <span class="foc">access memory</span> and why we need to <span class="foc">recontruct</span> them using either abstract or form-related cues. Broadly, I’m interested in online addressable memory-building, its interaction with syntactic dependencies in <span class="foc">typologically</span> different languages, and the nature of the mechanisms and representations this interaction involves.

With [Pavel Logacev][pavel], I focused on whether people's failure to notice ungrammatical sentences was due to more <span class="foc">cognitive-general</span> issues such as, response <span class="foc">bias</span>, <span class="foc">shallow</span> processing, or <span class="foc">task-effects</span>. Through series of behavioral experiments, we learned that even though that they affect to what degree people fail to assess grammaticality of a sentence, these cognitive-general issues cannot be sole explanation of failure to detect ungrammaticality.

## morpho-syntax

I was lucky to join [Pavel Caha][caha] at [Masaryk University][mas] to work on various topics including Turkish case syncretism, augmentatives, and suspended affixation.

One of the most exciting work I did was on Turkish adjectivals. I formalized the <span class="foc">degree-sensitivity</span> of Turkish Evaluative morphology, specifically "diminutives". Adjectival diminutives, in Turkish, only attaches to negative-ordered adjectives. I also showed that Turkish -CIK is actually a complex formative unlike previously believed. While -K is an inherent part of the adjective, -CI is the amplifier that attaches to <span class="foc">defective adjective "root"</span> that is stripped from -K.

I also tried to formalize <span class="foc">differential object marking</span> in Turkish. Using nanosyntactic algorithm, I modeled the nominal case paradigm of Turkish.

Lastly, I argued that candidates in morphology can be <span class="foc">re-ranked via phonological</span> information. Words with root suppletion generally is not licensed in suspended affixation. However, preceding only a vowel-harmonic conjunction, suppletion was reverted and suspended affixation was licensed.

## treebanking

As a part of two projects (funded by TUBITAK and European Commission), I partake in creation and re-annotation of multiple <span class="foc">Universal Dependencies</span> Treebanks in multiple languages. My current aim is to create a set of treebanks for <span class="foc">un(der)represented</span> languages in Asia Minor.

With [Arzucan Ozgur][ao], [Tunga Gungor][tg], and [Balkiz Ozturk][bo], we created a new guidelines for <span class="foc">annotating</span> Turkish data within Universal Dependencies framework. Following these guidelines, we re-annotated two already existing treebanks, and created a new treebank.

As a part of my efforts to document minority languages, we also created the first <span class="foc">Laz</span> treebank, using data from published linguistic papers and theses. I am currently working on <span class="foc">Ladino</span> and <span class="foc">Cappadocian Greek</span> (with Konstantinos Sampanis) treebanks. _I am extremely open to collaborate and willing to work on any minority language documentation/treebanking effort! Do not hesitate to reach out!_

## semantics

With [Omer Demirok][od], we investigated how <span class="foc">hypothetical comparions</span> are formed in Turkish. _-mışcasına_ is licensed with <span class="foc">gradable</span> adjectives but not with non-gradable ones. We took this to suggest that its semantics involves comparison of degrees. We pursued a previously uncharted route: HCM constructions in Turkish <span class="foc">compare degrees</span>, not eventualities. Our analysis is sensitive to the semantic difference between OPEN and CLOSE scale adjectives that are independently justified.

I am currently interested in how <span class="foc">pragmatic reality</span> is structured in natural language such as personal experiences, interpretation of indefinite nouns, and justified beliefs. To investigate these topics, I use data from de re/de dicto and acquitance inference literature.
