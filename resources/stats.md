Similar to [ling](/resources/ling/), this is where I collect blogs/posts/tweets and various resources about statistics. I do not have any formal education on statistics, apart from 1-2 courses I took from Pavel Logacev and Bruno Nicenboim. So, the stuff here may be all over the place. I may also insert here various stuff about R, python, or any other computing language. It may also have various cognitive science resources as well.
