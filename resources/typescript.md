I stopped using Word documents for various reasons, one of them is to have consistent pieces of writings. As page number increases, the problems become (not suprassable). LaTeX provided me a lot of tools to create easy pipelines (and also a lot of problems to procrastinate.) Right now, I mainly use a combination of R, markdown, yaml, and LaTeX to write my documents. I can easily integrate my code and my results without the hastle of copy-paste. Still though, if I am collaborating I either only use Google Docs or LaTeX. 

In this page, I share my resources/templates in scientific reporting and typescriting.
